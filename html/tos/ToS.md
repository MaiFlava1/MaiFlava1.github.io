### **5. Derived Content**

    - The creator of the derived content holds copyright over the newly introduced elements, such as unique styles, color schemes, or modifications.
    - If a derivative work is itself derived further, this principle applies recursively, requiring respect for all upstream copyrights in the chain of derivation.

2.  **Joint Rights Compliance:**
    - Any use of derived content must respect both the rights of the original creator and those of the creator of the derivative work.
    - Users must comply with all applicable terms, licenses, and conditions imposed by each rights holder.
    - In the event of a rights conflict between original and derived content, both sets of rights remain valid and enforceable within their respective scopes.

3.  **Example Scenarios:**
    - If a user creates fan art of a character, the original rights holder retains copyright over the character‚Äôs design and concept.
    - The user holds rights over their unique artistic expression (style, color choices, etc.). However, the resulting fan art is governed by both parties‚Äô rights.
