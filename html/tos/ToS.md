#### **5. Derived Content**

    - The author of the derived content holds the license for any new elements they introduce, such as style, colors, and unique modifications.

    - Any usage of derived content must comply with **both** the original content's license and the derived content's license.
    - Users must adhere to the restrictions and permissions outlined in both licenses.

3.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    - If there is a conflict between the original and derived content licenses, both licenses remain valid but must be followed in their respective scopes.
    - Users seeking to use derived content must obtain necessary permissions from **both** rights holders if required.

4.  **Example Scenarios:**
    - If user create fan art of a character, the character‚Äôs original rights holder maintains their license over the design and concept. User's unique artistic expression (style, color choices, etc.) falls under user's own license. However, the resulting fan art is bound by both licenses.
    - If a derivative work is created from content that is itself derived, this principle applies recursively, requiring adherence to all preceding licenses in the derivation chain.
